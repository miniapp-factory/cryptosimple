#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

I need to edit the app metadata to change the title and description, and create a new logo file.  
Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can propose the exact changes.

A stylized coin icon with a simple, modern design. The coin is a bright gold circle with a subtle gradient, featuring a minimalist token symbol (a small, abstract shape) centered in the middle. The background is a soft, light blue gradient that fades from a slightly darker shade at the top to a lighter shade at the bottom, giving the image a calm, professional look. The overall composition is clean and uncluttered, making the logo instantly recognizable and suitable for a tech-focused application.
